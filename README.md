# Radio Signatures of Exoplanets

This repository is a comprehensive one containing anything done as 
part of the Radio Signatures of Exoplanets research project led by 
Tansu Daylan. The codes use scientific knowledge acquired from various
research papers and books, most notably the paper 
"Detecting Magnetospheric Radio Emission from Giant Exoplanets" by 
Ashtari et al. 2022.

### Scaling Scripts
The Python scripts "radio-lum_2.py" and "scaling_of_radio_luminosity.py" 
serve the purpose of visualizing the scaling of radio luminosity of
exoplanets with some of their parameters. These are expected not to 
have any direct contribution to any research paper that might be published.

### The Module
The script "radio_module.py" provides a new module with an exoplanet class
and various functions that might be used throughout the project. 

### Expectation Script and the GUI.
The scripts "exoplanet_predictions.py" and "GUI_for_predictions.py" are
currently under development. The former is the main script that generates
a random sample of exoplanets by randomly assigning values drawn from
specific probability distributions to various characteristics of exoplanets.
It then plots the expectations of CMI radiation frequency and radio
brightnesses of the drawn sample.
